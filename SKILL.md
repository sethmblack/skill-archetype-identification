# Archetype Identification

Identify which archetypal patterns are active in a person's life, relationships, or situation—revealing the deeper story being lived.

---

## When to Use

- User feels stuck in a repeating pattern
- Major life transitions or crises
- Understanding the "role" someone is playing in their life
- Exploring relationship dynamics at a deeper level
- User asks "What pattern am I caught in?"
- Creative work needing character depth
- Making sense of why certain themes keep recurring
- Understanding what phase of life or journey they're in

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The life circumstance, pattern, or relationship to explore |
| feeling | Yes | The dominant emotional quality of the experience |
| history | No | Whether this pattern has appeared before |
| characters | No | Key people involved and their roles |

## Jung's Archetype Theory

Archetypes are universal patterns residing in the collective unconscious—inherited images that shape human experience across all cultures and eras. They are not rigid categories but dynamic energies that express through us.

### Core Concept

"Archetypes are like riverbeds which dry up when the water deserts them, but which it can find again at any time. An archetype is like an old watercourse along which the water of life has flowed for centuries, digging a deep channel for itself."

You don't "have" an archetype—you are *living* one, often unconsciously.

### Why Archetypes Matter

- **Patterns have power.** Unconscious identification with an archetype drives behavior.
- **Recognition brings choice.** Once you see the pattern, you can work with it consciously.
- **Archetypes are neutral.** Each has light and shadow expressions.
- **Life moves through archetypal stages.** Understanding your current archetype illuminates your journey.

## Major Archetypal Patterns

### The Journey Archetypes

| Archetype | Core Energy | Light Expression | Shadow Expression |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **The Innocent** | Trust, optimism, faith | Seeing goodness, maintaining hope | Denial, naivety, victimhood |
| **The Orphan** | Resilience, solidarity | Empathy, realism, interdependence | Cynicism, victimhood, manipulation |
| **The Hero** | Courage, mastery | Achieving goals, protecting others | Arrogance, ruthlessness, burnout |
| **The Caregiver** | Compassion, nurturing | Genuine service, generosity | Martyrdom, enabling, controlling through care |
| **The Seeker** | Authenticity, freedom | Self-discovery, pioneering | Chronic dissatisfaction, isolation |
| **The Destroyer** | Letting go, transformation | Releasing what's dead, making space | Destruction for its own sake, nihilism |
| **The Lover** | Connection, passion | Intimacy, commitment, appreciation | Obsession, jealousy, loss of self |
| **The Creator** | Innovation, expression | Bringing new things into being | Perfectionism, creative blocks, impracticality |
| **The Ruler** | Order, responsibility | Effective leadership, creating stability | Tyranny, rigidity, control obsession |
| **The Magician** | Transformation, vision | Catalyzing change, healing | Manipulation, trickery, inflation |
| **The Sage** | Wisdom, understanding | Truth-seeking, teaching | Coldness, dogmatism, detachment |
| **The Jester** | Joy, liberation | Lightness, perspective, play | Irresponsibility, cruelty, avoidance |

### The Primary Four (Jung's Core Archetypes)

| Archetype | Function | Typical Manifestation |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Persona** | Social mask | The face we show the world; necessary adaptation |
| **Shadow** | Rejected self | What we deny in ourselves; projected onto others |
| **Anima/Animus** | Contrasexual soul | Inner feminine (in men) / Inner masculine (in women) |
| **The Self** | Wholeness | The totality; the goal of individuation |

### Relationship Archetypes

| Archetype | Dynamic |
|-----------|---------|
| **The Great Mother** | Nurturing or devouring; giving life or consuming it |
| **The Father** | Authority, guidance; supporting or oppressing |
| **The Divine Child** | New potential, innocence, hope; also vulnerability |
| **The Wise Old Man/Woman** | Guidance, wisdom, truth; or manipulation and false authority |
| **The Trickster** | Disruption, boundary-crossing, unexpected truth |
| **The Shadow Figure** | Same-sex figure representing disowned qualities |
| **The Anima/Animus Figure** | Opposite-sex figure representing soul connection or projection |

## The Identification Process

### Step 1: Map the Situation

- What is the central drama or conflict?
- Who are the main "characters" (including you)?
- What role are you playing? What role are others playing?
- What is the emotional intensity and quality?

### Step 2: Feel the Pattern

Archetypes are felt before they are understood:
- Does this feel familiar? Like something you've lived before?
- Is there a mythic or fairy-tale quality to the situation?
- What story template does this resemble?

### Step 3: Identify the Active Archetype(s)

Consider:
- What energy is dominant in you right now?
- What archetypal role are you cast in (or casting yourself in)?
- Are you in the light or shadow expression?
- What archetype might you be projecting onto others?

### Step 4: Examine the Archetypal Stage

Life moves through archetypal phases:
- **First half of life:** Building ego, Persona, achieving Hero tasks
- **Midlife transition:** Hero journey exhausted; Seeker emerges
- **Second half of life:** Individuation; Sage, Ruler, or integration archetypes

Where are you in the larger journey?

### Step 5: Explore Light and Shadow

Every archetype has both:
- What is the constructive potential of this energy?
- What is the shadow expression you may be falling into?
- What would integration look like?

### Step 6: Consider the Counter-Archetype

What archetype is missing or underdeveloped?
- If Hero is dominant, Lover may be neglected
- If Caregiver is dominant, Seeker may be suppressed
- If Sage is dominant, Jester may be shadow

## Constraints

- **Archetypes are not boxes.** Don't reduce people to types. Archetypes are dynamic energies, not fixed categories.
- **Multiple archetypes are always active.** Don't oversimplify to one.
- **Avoid inflation.** Identifying with Hero or Sage can inflate the ego. The archetype is not you—it moves through you.
- **Shadow is not bad.** The shadow of an archetype is its unconscious expression, not its evil twin.
- **Context matters.** The same archetype means different things at different life stages.
- **This is not diagnosis.** Archetypal exploration is for insight and growth, not labeling or pathologizing.

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've spent my whole career building this company. I sacrificed relationships, health, weekends—everything. We finally sold it for a lot of money. But instead of feeling triumphant, I feel empty. Like I don't know who I am without the fight. I keep looking for the next battle but nothing excites me."

**Output:**

## Archetype Identification

### The Situation
Entrepreneur who achieved major success through sacrifice now faces post-achievement emptiness, identity confusion, and inability to find new purpose.

### Primary Active Archetype: The Hero (Exhausted)

**Core Energy:** Courage, achievement, mastery, proving worth through accomplishment

**How It's Manifesting:**
- Decades of sacrifice for a goal (the Hero's quest)
- Identity fused with the battle ("don't know who I am without the fight")
- Seeking the next challenge (Hero can only move forward)
- Emptiness when the dragon is slain

**Light Expression:** Tremendous achievement, discipline, the capacity to build something from nothing
**Shadow Expression:** Identity consumed by doing; relationships sacrificed; worth dependent on winning; no self outside the quest

### Current Expression Assessment
**Light ←―――[X]――→ Shadow**
The Hero served well but has become a trap. The quest succeeded, but the quester is lost.

### Secondary/Supporting Archetypes
- **The Ruler (nascent):** Built something, commanded resources—but Ruler was in service to Hero's quest, not genuine leadership of self
- **The Orphan (hidden):** The original wound that drove the Hero—what were you proving, and to whom?

### What May Be Missing
**Underdeveloped Archetype:** The Lover
**Why It Matters:** The Lover archetype connects us to life, beauty, relationships, pleasure—everything sacrificed for the quest. The emptiness you feel is the Lover's absence. You conquered the kingdom but forgot what makes it worth living in.

Also missing: **The Sage**—the wisdom to reflect on meaning, not just achievement.

### The Deeper Pattern
This is the classic Hero's return—the phase of the journey most stories skip. You slayed the dragon. You got the treasure. Now you're supposed to return home transformed. But you never built a home. You never became someone who could rest. The Hero archetype has no "after"—only the next battle. This is why it feels empty: you're trying to use Hero energy for a non-Hero challenge.

Mythic parallel: Odysseus after Troy. The war is won, but the journey home—the integration—takes another ten years.

### Life Stage Context
This is textbook midlife individuation. The first-half-of-life task (building ego, achieving, Hero work) is complete. The second-half task is different: meaning, integration, becoming whole—not just successful. The old map no longer works because you've entered new territory.

### Integration Path
**To work with this consciously:**

1. **Grieve the Hero.** The fight is over. Let it be over. The emptiness is not a problem to solve—it's a passage to walk through.

2. **Ask the question you've been avoiding:** "Who am I if I'm not building, winning, or proving?" Sit with not knowing.

3. **Invoke the Lover.** What do you love that you've neglected? Not what's "productive"—what brings joy, connection, beauty? Start small.

4. **Seek the Sage.** Find mentors, teachers, or contemplative practices that address meaning, not achievement. The question shifts from "What can I accomplish?" to "What does my life mean?"

5. **Consider the Caregiver.** Your hard-won resources and wisdom could serve others. Not as another Hero quest, but as genuine giving.

### The Jungian Perspective
The exhausted Hero is one of the most common crises of successful people at midlife. You have proven something—perhaps to yourself, perhaps to a parent or world that doubted you. But the proving is done. The psyche is now demanding a different relationship with life.

The emptiness is not failure; it is invitation. The part of you that was never in the fight—the part that can simply be, that can love without purpose, that can find meaning in presence rather than progress—that part has been waiting all these years. It is finally your turn to meet yourself.

*"The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it."*

What remains when the Hero rests?
